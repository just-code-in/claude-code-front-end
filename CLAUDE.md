This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This appears to be an empty repository with no existing codebase, configuration files, or project structure.

## Development Setup

Since this is an empty repository, you'll need to:
1. Initialize the project with appropriate configuration files based on the intended technology stack
2. Set up build tools, package managers, and development dependencies as needed
3. Create initial project structure and architecture

## Notes

- This repository currently contains no source code, configuration files, or documentation
- Future development should establish appropriate tooling and project structure before implementing features
- Consider adding package.json (Node.js), requirements.txt (Python), Cargo.toml (Rust), or equivalent based on chosen technology stack
